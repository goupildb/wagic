Mountain (10E)  *24
Crimson Kobolds (LEG)   *4
Crookshank Kobolds (LEG)*4
Kobold Drill Sergeant (LEG) *4
Kobold Overlord (LEG)   *4
Kobold Taskmaster (LEG) *4
Kobolds of Kher Keep (LEG)  *4
Keldon Warlord (RV) *4
#   Doesn't fit the theme too well (would a Keldon Warlord really
#   work as a mercenary for a Kobold Overlord?), but without it
#   the deck would be too weak, and a deck full of weak
#   creatures is exactly the environment where a Keldon Warlord
#   thrives.
Wheel of Fortune (RV)   *1
#To get a new hand (hopefully) full of cheap kobolds once the
#previous hand has been used up. Only 1 because it's
#restricted.
Slate of Ancestry (ONS) *3
#To draw more cards (check whether the AI overuses it and
#decks itself out)
Howling Mine (10E)  *4
#
#
# Cards considered, but not included:
# Orcish Oriflamme - would match the deck's focus of
#   strengthening the creatures, but is too expensive. Perhaps add
#   it when mana acceleration via Brightstone Ritual works.
#
# Cards removed from he deck:
# 3 x Bravado (USG) (ID 5848)
# The card's name and illustration don't really fit the "kobold"
# theme, but the effect (strength through numbers) definitely
# does.
# Removed because the AI cast it on its opponent's creatures.
#
# 4 x Brightstone Ritual (ONS) (ID 39846)
# for mana acceleration
# Removed because the AI doesn't use the mana.
#
# 2 x Kher Keep (TSP) (ID 113553)
# For bringing additional kobolds into play
# AI taps Kher Keep for mana and then can't
# use that mana to produce a kobold token.
