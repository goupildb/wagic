# Cards considered, but not included:
# Creakwood Liege - not a snake
# Coiled Tinviper - mechanical snake, bad thematic fit
# Plague Wind - considered as endgame surprise, but doesn't fit
#   the theme well enough

# Cards removed from the deck:
# Serpent Assassin - AI kills its own creatures with it.

# Notes:
# I haven't found any information about the Orochi, so I can't
# tell whether they fit to the rest of the cards apart from the
# fact that they are snakes. If they don't fit, replacement
# suggestions are welcome.
