<text y="45">Spells have a cost represented by mana symbols on the top right corner</text>

<text y="15">You did great, young adventurer!</text>

<text y="45">Sometimes the cost contains a number with no mana color. It means you can</text>
<text y="60">pay with mana of whatever color you want.</text>
<text y="75">for example a card which cost has a number "1" and a green icon</text>
