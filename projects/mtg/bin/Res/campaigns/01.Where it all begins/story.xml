<text>you just have to click on it with the action button (CIRCLE by default)</text>

<title>WELL DONE...NOW LET'S CAST A SPELL</title>
<text>That was too easy for you!</text>
<text>Now let's see if you can cast a spell...</text>
<text>Spells have a cost represented by mana symbols on the top right corner</text>
<text>of the card. For example, 2 white mana icons on the top right of the card</text>
<text>means that you have to produce 2 white manas (by activating 2 plains)</text>
<text>in order to put it into play.</text>

<title>PERFECT...BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT</title>
<text>You did great, young adventurer!</text>
<text>But you will see that some spells have slighlty different costs.</text>
<text>Sometimes the cost contains a number with no mana color. It means you can</text>
<text>pay with mana of whatever color you want.</text>
<text>for example a card which cost has a number "1" and a green icon</text>
<text>needs you to pay 1 green mana +  a mana of any color if you want to play it.</text>

<title>GREAT. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT PHASES</title>
<text>Once you put them into play, you will want your creatures to attack your opponent.</text>
<text>After all, they are here to help you defeat other sorcerers!</text>
<text>Your creatures can't attack anytime they want, however,</text>
<text>they must wait for the combat phase of your turn.</text>
<text>Your turn is divided into several phases. You can go through the phases by</text>
<text>clicking on LTRIGGER by default. The name of the current phase is displayed on the</text>
<text>top right corner of the screen.</text>

<title>GOOD!</title>
<text>Let me tell you a bit more about phases.</text>
<text>Your turn is divided into several phases. The actions you can perform</text>
<text>Depend on the phase you're in. For now, let's say that you can:</text>
<text>- Play creatures during the "main phase 1" and the "main phase 2" phases of your turn.</text>
<text>- Attack with your creatures during the "Attackers" phase of your turn.</text>
<text>- Block your opponent's attacking creatures during the "blockers" phase of his turn.</text>
<text>There are lots of other phases but we'll discuss them later</text>
