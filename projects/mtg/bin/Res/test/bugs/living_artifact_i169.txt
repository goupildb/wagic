#NAME: Living Artifact
#DESC: I checked an old bug list entry claiming that
#DESC: Living Artifact "gives you one life whenever
#DESC: a card is tapped". I couldn't reproduce that.
#DESC: However, I couldn't produce *any* effect from
#DESC: Living Artifact either.
#DESC: The script first tests for the condition of
#DESC: the bug report mentioned above, then tries to
#DESC: activate Living Artifact when it should be
#DESC: possible. The Assert part may need tweaking
#DESC: since I have no way of knowing how Living
#DESC: Artifact is assumed to be activated correctly.
#DESC: See http://code.google.com/p/wagic/issues/detail?id=169
