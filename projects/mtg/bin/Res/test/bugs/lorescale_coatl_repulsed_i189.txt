#NAME: Lorescale Coatl repulsed
#DESC: A bug report claimed that the PSP crashed
#DESC: after casting Repulse on one's own
#DESC: Lorescale Coatl. The Coatl was sent to its
#DESC: owner's hand, but its pump ability still
#DESC: triggered.
#DESC: The script just prepares the cards and waits
#DESC: for you to cast Repulse on the Coatl. On
#DESC: Windows I managed to reproduce the odd
#DESC: behavior (the Coatl's ability triggering
#DESC: after it has been repulsed), but not the
#DESC: crash. Nevertheless it looks fishy, so I'm
#DESC: committing the script for other people to
#DESC: test on PSPs.
