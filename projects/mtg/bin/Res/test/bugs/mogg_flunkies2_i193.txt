#NAME: Mogg Flunkies
#DESC: Testbed for two situations:
#DESC: 1. If you choose the Grizzly Bears as
#DESC:    attackers, then choose one Mogg
#DESC:    Flunkies as attacker, and then remove
#DESC:    the Grizzly Bears as attackers, then
#DESC:    the Mogg Flunkies shouldn't be able
#DESC:    to attack
#DESC: 2. Choosing two Mogg Flunkies as attackers
#DESC:    should work, but how can one do that
#DESC:    without selecting the Grizzly Bears
#DESC:    first?
