#NAME: Shield of the Ages
#DESC: Shield of the Ages was hardcoded and
#DESC: probably depended on damage going on
#DESC: the stack. Since this (correctly) doesn't
#DESC: happen any more, SotA has no effect.
#DESC: However, something else must also be
#DESC: going wrong, since SotA wants me to
#DESC: specify a target. It shouldn't.
