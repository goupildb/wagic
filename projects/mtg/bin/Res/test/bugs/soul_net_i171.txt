#NAME: Soul Net
#DESC: Soul Net was reported to be unusable
#DESC: in the opponent's turn. Research revealed
#DESC: that it currently isn't usable at all.
#DESC: The script has player 0 sacrifice a Mogg
#DESC: Fanatic to kill a Savannah Lions, and
#DESC: then try to gain 1 Life for each of the
#DESC: two creatures through Soul Net. Then the
#DESC: opponent sacrifices a Thrull, and player 0
#DESC: tries to use Soul Net again.
#DESC: The script may need adapting, I can't be
#DESC: sure how Soul Net is supposed to work, so
#DESC: I had to guess.
