#NAME: Sylvan Basilisk
#DESC: Sylvan Basilisk should *only* destroy
#DESC: creatures blocking it (not creatures
#DESC: blocked *by* it), and it should destroy
#DESC: these at the end of the "Declare Blockers"
#DESC: step, so it never takes any damage from
#DESC: them. Nevertheless it should not deal
#DESC: damage to the opponent if it had been
#DESC: blocked at some point (unless it has
#DESC: Trample).
#DESC: In the script, the Sylvan Basilisk blocks
#DESC: a Giant Spider (which should survive),
#DESC: then gets blocked by Gosta Dirk (who
#DESC: should be destroyed without having a
#DESC: chance to kill the Sylvan Basilisk), and
#DESC: then the Sylvan Basilisk should not deal
#DESC: any damage to player 0.
